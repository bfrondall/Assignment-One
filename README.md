DESCRIPTION:

I wanted to create a nostalgic old school look reminiscent of an old VHS screen. To achieve this effect I found a VHS gif and I overlayed on the actual screen on the webpage, with the help of some code that I found on codepen.io. Furthermore, I also wanted to explore a little more with text, so I found some code to create a ‘glitchy’ feel with the text to make it look more nostalgic. I did however, have trouble with the font colours, as the code I found was best for gradients, but I chose an old school, vaporwave colour scheme for the paragraph fonts -again, to keep the nostalgia- and opted for one of the school colours for the header font colors.

ISSUES:
I tried a number of things to achieve this effect, like turning it into a popup, however, I was very unsuccessful and could not figure out how to allow the gif to be transferred to the webpage by the click of a button. Moreover, I created it for one webpage, as I was having troubles making the gid work properly on other webpages. For example, in some cases, when the gif was applied, I couldn’t click on any extensions from that webpages. That has since been fixed on the u of l site, but some sites had the issue.
